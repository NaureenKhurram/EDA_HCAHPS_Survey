# HCAHPS Patient Survey

This project looks at the national & state-level scores for the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, from 2013 to 2022.
This is a national, standardized survey of hospital patients about their experiences during a recent inpatient hospital stay.

It looks at the types of measures that were assessed, what questions were asked, and how the results varied on a national and state level.
